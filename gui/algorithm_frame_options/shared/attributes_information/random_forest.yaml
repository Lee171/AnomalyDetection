N estimators: "Parameter information : The number of trees in the forest."

Criterion: "Parameter information : The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are 'mse' for
the mean squared error, which is equal to variance reduction as feature selection criterion, and 'mae' for the
mean absolute error."

Max features: "Parameter information : The number of features to consider when looking for the best split"

Random state: "Parameter information : Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used when
building trees (if bootstrap=True) and the sampling of the features to consider when looking for the best split at
each node (if max_features < n_features)."

Window size: "Parameter information : The amount of records to look back while calculation a prediction for a current
record."

Threshold: "Parameter information : An 'X' value which represents the value that X% records has a lower value than it.
It is used to detect anomalies."
