# AnomalyDetection

A system which will create a comparison between different anomaly detection algorithms based on streaming data from UAV sensors in to order to get the earliest possible detection of GPS spoofing attacks on UAVâ€™s.

## Getting Started

First, you should clone the project to your local computer.
1. Run 'guiController.py' file in order to run the system.
2. Currently the flow of creating new model is working(load existing model will be available later).
3. Enter valid inputs for train,test and results directories.
4. Choose LSTM and edit the parameters in order to continue to next step in the system (LSTM is working, more algorithms will be available later).
5. Skip the next step (will be available later).
6. Choose cosine similarity function (optional).
7. Run new model.

### Prerequisites

You should run the command (before run the system) in the console

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
